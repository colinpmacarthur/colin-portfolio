               <h4 class="header">Los Alamos Public Schools needed to simplify and streamline its websites.</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  LAPS' websites were cluterred and hard to navigate. Parents, teachers and the school board members were clamoring for a simpler
                  navigation scheme and visual design.

               <h4 class="header">I asked: How might we recategorize and relabel existing content to better meet parent needs?</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  School staff don't have time to create content, but could recategorize and relabele existing content to make navigation the
                  website easier.

                  </figure>
                  I conducted focus groups with parents, teachers and administrators representing elementary schools, the middle school, high
                  school and the district office to identify their goals for the website and what content was most essential to meeting them.
                  I then conducted three rounds of usability testing on prototypes of a new elementary, middle school, high school and district
                  office website. I designed the prototypes, revised them after each test and presented my findings to several groups of staff
                  and administrators.

               <h4 class="header">Parents navigated school websites faster and happier after the redesign.</h4>

                  </figure>
                  In follow-up usability testing, parents navigated school websites faster, with fewer clicks and less frustration. Many commented
                  that they felt more appreciated by the school district after participating in usability testing. School staff also saw the
                  value of usability testing and asked me to train them how to to it themselves.

               <h4 class="header">What I learned: Usability includes more than interfaces.</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  Over the course of the usability testing, I learned much more about the district and its parents than I expected. When I started
                  usability tests, I heard thoughts of the district's leadership, teacher performance and the challenges of parenting. I realized
                  all these things were part of "the usability of the school district," even though it wasn't my job to change many of them.
