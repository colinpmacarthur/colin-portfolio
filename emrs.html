               <div class="body ">
                  There are many apps, websites and devices that help us eat better and exercise more. But none are sa ofted used as patient-facing
                  electronic medical records.

               <h4 class="header">I asked: How might patient-facing electronic medical direct visitors to preventative health behaviors?</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  Patient-facing electronic medical records, or the website patients visit to see upcoming doctor's appointments and test results,
                  are the most frequently used medical technology. They currently play little role in changing patient behavior. For my "Health
                  Care and the Information Economy" class, I explored how patient-facing EMRs could help people change their behavior.

               <h4 class="header">I tested interface tweaks to a common patient-facing EMR which could drive patients to a online intervention program.</h4>

                  </figure>
                  After reviewing existing academic research on patient-facing electronic medical record use and persuasive techniques, I used
                  Photoshop to create four alternative versions of an EMR's test results page. Each employed a different persuasive technique
                  to encourage users to click the "sign up for an online exercise program" link. I then showed 50 Mechanical Turk users each
                  version (for a total 200 participants) and asked them where they would click.

               <div class="caption">Results / Impact:</div>
               <h4 class="header">Reducing the graphical complexity of the test results lead 35% more people to the behavioral intervention.</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  
                  <figure style="float:right; width:15em;"><img src="images/emrs_graph.png" alt="Number of clicks to intervention by persuasive technique"><figcaption>Number of clicks to intervention by persuasive technique</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  When Mechanical Turk users were presented with test results in a graph, instead of a table, they were far more likely to click
                  on the "sign up for an exercise program" link. The results of this preliminary test suggest that interface changes, particularly
                  those that reduce complexity, can persuade more people to persue a preventative health behavior.

               <div class="body ">
                  When I started this project, I thought I would come up with create miraculous behavior-changing interface tweaks myself. But
                  the really effective interface changes were drawn for years of behavior change research I applied to the new context. I learned
                  the value of thorough review of other's work, before jumping into my own work of the future.
