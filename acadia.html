                  Current 12-17 year olds are less likely to visit national parks than any other age group. But parks need them to become the
                  next generation of park stewards and advocates.

                  The internet, smartphones, GPS, digital signage and sensor networks are an increasingly large part of park visitors' experience.
                  Instead of decrying the effect of technology on the park experience, we wondered how technology could deepen peoples' (especially
                  young peoples') connection with their parks.

                  I led a team of high school interns observing their and others' park experiences, generating insights, and writing proposals
                  for  park websites, apps, games and programs. I also liased with a visiting organizational behavior PhD student, who created
                  detailed plans for implementing the youth ideas. I also managed an assistant team leader, who kept the group safe and happy.

                  The team wrote 11 proposals for using mobile devices, websites and other technology to better connect young people with the
                  landscape and enhance the visitor experience. Almost all were funded and developed in subsequent years. The high schoolers
                  (now college juniors) who designed the projects are still involved in their creation and maintenance.

               <div class="body ">
                  All my expectations about what my high school co-designers would want to do (and not) were wrong. I thought they wouldn't
                  want to write proposals, but they did. I thought they'd be interested in the technical details, but they weren't. I'd just
                  share the design process with them, but learned which parts to share with them.
