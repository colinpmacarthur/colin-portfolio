                  California State Park Foundation (CSPF) discovered that state park visitors desperately wanted more information about state
                  parks. The old solutions to the problem, like building new signs, are too expensive and bureaucratically complicated.

               <div class="body ">Standard park media designers start by asking, "What do we want visitors to know?" We took a different, user-centered approach
                  and asked "What information do park visitors want?" Instead of assuming that visitors like using their tablets and phones
                  in all stages of their park visit, we explored what they like using and when.

                  We explored unmet needs in focus groups and diary studies in Northern and Sourthern California and a survey to further explore
                  visitor's use of technology, especially post-visit. I created the project schedule, led our team meetings, communicated with
                  project stakeholders, held group members to deadlines and established processes for recruiting. I conducted in-park observations
                  and wrote much of our final reccomendations and designed the "park activites diagram" below. I was the sole presenter of our
                  findings to State Park Foundation leadership team.

                  We identified 10 information-seeking activities many park visitors do and explored how various existing sources of information
                  met those needs. I worked with the product design team at 36 Views to envision an app which could meet unmet needs and be
                  financially sustainable. The Park Foundation is considering making the app a cornerstone of their new media / new revenue
                  program.

               <div class="body ">
                  Many psychologists argue we have two systems of thinking: a "hot," emotional system and a "cold," deliberative one. After
                  dragging my team through a weekend of gradual, but unproductive, affinity diagramming, I realized  generating insights sometimes
                  requires thinking hot. When we limited our time and set a temporary moratorium on "overthinking," we found what ultimately
                  mattered to the State Park Foundation. We double checked those "hot insights" systematically later, but learned to trust some
                  emotion in initial qualitiative data analysis.
