                  I designed a process of rapid cycles of design and testing to explore new ideas and identify profitable ones. Although original,
                  this process was inspired by The Lean Startup and The Agile Manifesto. I trained our team on this new approach, and tested it by building quick prototypes, conducting remote user tests and reporting
                  on the results.

               <div class="body ">
                  As well as netting useful insights for a pending project, trying this new process showed its value. We now explain our lean
                  approach to new clients as a unique (for this industry) approach to make sure they focus on what customer's want (and spend
                  little  on everything else).

               <h4 class="header">What I learned: Becoming lean is about building a culture of "hypothesis testing."</h4>
               <div class="body ">
                  As I trained our team, I realized using the process wouldn't make us lean. It would be when we started thinking of new ideas
                  a "hypotheses to be tested" instead of "products to be developed." Being a "lean" company is not just frequent design/test
                  cycles, but about sharing the mindset that big ideas deserve small tests.
